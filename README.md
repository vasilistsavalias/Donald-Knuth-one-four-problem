# Donald Knuth one-four problem
 Donald Knuth, a renowned computer scientist and mathematician, famously challenged readers to represent every positive integer using only the number 4 exactly four times, along with the mathematical operations of square root (√), floor function (⌊⌋), and division (/). It's also called |The Four 4s puzzle"  An even more formidable iteration of this puzzle elevates the difficulty by imposing a singular usage of the number four. The objective remains to construct representations for all positive integers, employing exclusively this solitary "four" alongside the aforementioned mathematical operations.
